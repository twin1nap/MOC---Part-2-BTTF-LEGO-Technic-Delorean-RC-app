an pc rc app for https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-95085/Mr.Platinum/part-2-bttf-lego-technic-delorean-rc/#details programmed in python using https://github.com/undera/pylgbst and pygame for the ui an its converted to an exe using pyinstaller.

this project is currently work in progress and only preperation is done, no beta or alpha files are created, the only thing thats done is learning how to use pylgbst, testing code and writing the code that came with the lego mock in pseudo code.
the versions of the exe will be free to download but the code wont be shared due to it being based on a bougth guid on how to create that exact code in the powered up app for mobile, test files and other files will be shared if its not based on the code for the lego MOC.
